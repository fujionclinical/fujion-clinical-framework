<h1>Patient Goals</h1>
<p class="Bdytxt1">The main function of Patient Goals is to facilitate 
 the participation of a patient in their plan of care.</p>
<p class="Bdytxt1">Patient goal setting is a patient-driven activity through 
 which the clinician provides a supportive role in assisting the patient 
 in setting goals that are well defined and achievable. The Patient Goals 
 component provides the clinician with a tool that can capture and document 
 the patient’s self-defined goals, and serve as a location where these 
 goals can be monitored and followed up. Patient Goals enables documentation 
 of the following:</p>
<ul type="disc">
	<li><p class="Bdytxt1">A goal set or not set at the visit</p></li>
	<li><p class="Bdytxt1">A free-text field to indicate the patient’s 
	 goals in their own words</p></li>
	<li><p class="Bdytxt1">A goal categorization field for aggregation 
	 and reporting purposes</p></li>
	<li><p class="Bdytxt1">Reason for goal (or motivation for goal)</p></li>
	<li><p class="Bdytxt1">Goal start date</p></li>
	<li><p class="Bdytxt1">Goal follow-up date</p></li>
	<li><p class="Bdytxt1">Goal steps (when smaller steps are necessary 
	 to meet a larger goal)</p></li>
	<li><p class="Bdytxt1">Ability to document short notes during goal 
	 follow up visits</p></li>
	<li><p class="Bdytxt1">Ability to alter the status of the goal to reflect 
	 active goals (goals that have been created or are being maintained), 
	 as well as inactivation of goals (goals that have been met or stopped)</p></li>
</ul>
