<h3>Remote Access</h3>
<p class="Bdytxt1">Each subscriber organization establishes its own policies 
 for determining which employees may work at home or in other remote workplace 
 locations. Any remote work arrangement should include policies that:</p>
<ul type="disc">
	<li><p class="Bdytxt1">Are in writing.</p></li>
	<li><p class="Bdytxt1">Provide authentication of the remote user through 
	 the use of ID and password or other acceptable technical means.</p></li>
	<li><p class="Bdytxt1">Outline the work requirements and the security 
	 safeguards and procedures the employee is expected to follow.</p></li>
	<li><p class="Bdytxt1">Ensure adequate storage of files, removal, and 
	 non-recovery of temporary files created in processing sensitive data, 
	 virus protection, and intrusion detection, and provide physical security 
	 for government equipment and sensitive data.</p></li>
	<li><p class="Bdytxt1">Establish mechanisms to back up data created 
	 and/or stored at alternate work locations.</p></li>
</ul>
<p class="Bdytxt1">Remote RPMS users shall:</p>
<ul type="disc">
	<li><p class="Bdytxt1">Remotely access RPMS through a virtual private 
	 network (VPN) whenever possible. Use of direct dial-in access must 
	 be justified and approved in writing and its use secured in accordance 
	 with industry best practices or government procedures.</p></li>
</ul>
<p class="Bdytxt1">Remote RPMS users shall not:</p>
<ul type="disc">
	<li><p class="Bdytxt1">Disable any encryption established for network, 
	 internet, and Web browser communications.</p></li>
</ul>
